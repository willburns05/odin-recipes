    <h1>Easy Acai Smoothie Bowl</h1>
    <img src="./acaipic.webp" alt="Acai Bowl">
    <h2>Description</h2>    
    <p>This acai smoothie bowl is a delicious breakfast. My kids like it, so I sweeten it with honey, but you can also use agave for a vegan version or not sweeten it at all.<br> Top the smoothie bowls with some granola for crunch, nuts, or other berries of your choosing.    </p>
    <h2>Ingrediants:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>7 ounces frozen unsweetened acai pulp, partially defrosted in refrigerator overnight</li>
        <li>2 medium ripe frozen bananas</li>
        <li>1 cup blueberries</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup almond milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons honey, or to taste</li>
        <h3>Topping:</h3>
        <li>1 medium banana, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh blueberries, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon pomegranate seeds, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon large coconut flakes, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Step 1</b><br>Combine acai, bananas, blueberries, almond milk, and honey in a blender. Blend until smooth. Smoothie should have a thick consistency, like frozen yogurt.</li>
        <li><b>Step 2</b><br>Pour into 2 bowls and top with banana slices, blueberries, pomegranate seeds, and coconut.</li>
    </ol>
